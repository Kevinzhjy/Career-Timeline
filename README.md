# Career Timeline - Middleman Résumé Template

While ago I designed a minimal resume to send it as a pdf when applying for a job, you can view and download the free PSD template from this [link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/Career-Timeline-Free-PSD-Template/13319023)

I decided to code it so it can be send as an HTML page insted of a PDF and extend the functiuonality to add a job description as well, as you can see in the [Demo.](http://karimtarek.com/career-timeline-template/)

Now, if you have no idea what Middleman is, but you still want to use "Career Timeline" you'll going to find the HTML version in `build` directory.

I really ecourage you to use Middleman, it's going to make your life much easier when it comes to front-end development in general and when editing this template.

I tried to make the template as geric as possible, so the layout can fit any similar content, but I'm sure someone will manage to break it, in this case you got to digg into `/source/css/style.scss` and you know the rest.

## Why Career Timeline?
If you are applying for a job and you don't have enough time to create your own résumé from scratch or if you need a quick fix to your current résumé it might be a good idea to use it.

## Installation

You need to install [middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman) before being able to use the "Career Timeline".

## Getting Started

Once Middleman is installed, go to "Career Timeline" directory using Terminal/Command line and run `bundle install` to make sure you install all the required gems and then run `middleman` command to make sure middleman installation is good and start adding your content.

Once you make sure your Middleman is installed and you can preview `index.html.erb` in the browser at: `http://localhost:4567/`, now if you like the layout and you think its going  to workout for your content you can open `data/career_timeline.yml` and start replacing the content with your content.
